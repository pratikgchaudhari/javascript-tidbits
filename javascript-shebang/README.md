### Unleashing JavaScript with the Shebang Comment

Let’s talk about the `shebang (#!)` comment in JavaScript, also known as the `hashbang` comment. 

This little trick works like its Unix counterpart, telling the OS which interpreter to use for your code.

In JavaScript, it’s all about the JavaScript engine. So why use the `shebang` comment at all? 

If you’re fine with typing `node` before your script’s name:

```javascript
node my-script.js
```

you don’t need it. 

But if you’re like me and prefer shortcuts, the `shebang` comment is your friend. 

Without it, trying to run a `.js` file directly gives you an error since the shell script executor doesn't understand JavaScript.

Here’s where the `shebang` comment saves the day. It tells the OS to use the JavaScript interpreter (`node.js` in non-browser environments), saving you from extra typing and errors.

For the `shebang` comment to work, your script must follow a few rules:

1. The `shebang` comment must be the **first** line in your script.
2. The comment starts with `#!`.
3. No spaces before the `#!`.

Though `Node.js` unofficially supported the `shebang` comment for a while, it was officially standardized in 2023 with `ES14`.

Does the `shebang` comment grant JavaScript new superpowers? Nope. Browsers shrug it off, just like `Node.js`.

To see this in action, check out my JS script emulating a conversation between [Elliot Alderson](https://mrrobot.fandom.com/wiki/Elliot_Alderson) and [Mr. Robot](https://mrrobot.fandom.com/wiki/Mr._Robot) about "reality" from Season 1, Episode 10.
